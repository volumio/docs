## List of compatible Rotary Encoders
The list currently lists only the ALPS Encoder I used for my project. I am convinced, that it works with others as well. I found some other projects using dtoverlay that use KY040 for example or other ALPS types.   
**_Please add yours to the list to help others. If you do not know how to edit this file in Github, create an issue with the information and I will integrate it someday._**
