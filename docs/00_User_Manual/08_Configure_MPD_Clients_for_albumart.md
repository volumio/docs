When starting the MPod app for the first time:
* Select "Add player manually" and fill in the following information:
- Connection - Name: Volumio
- MPD - Server: ip address or hostname of your volumio device (the hostname defaults to volumio.local)
- Local Cover Art - URL: volumio.local/cover-art
- Local Cover Art - Cover Filename: folder.jpg

Leave all other settings at the default.

Important note: The cover art URL including the file name is case sensitive (i.e. folder.jpg != Folder.jpg). All your music folders need to use the same casing.
